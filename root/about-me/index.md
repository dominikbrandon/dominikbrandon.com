Hey, it's good to see you here! I don't really know how did you find yourself in this place, you've reached the end of the Internet, congratulations.
Anyway, as you're already here, let me introduce myself to you.

<p>
<img src="/assets/images/dominik.webp" alt="This is how my face looks like" id="about-me-face">
<span>My name is Dominik Grzelak, I live in Pozna≈Ñ, Poland and I spend most of the time <strong>building software</strong>.
I don't yet consider myself a very experienced coder - it was just 2018 when I started my professional career.
Obviously, I've learned a lot since then. I believe it's largely thanks to great people that I've been lucky to work with,
from whom I could learn, and even more importantly - with whom I could discuss different ideas.</span>
</p>

Even though I feel like I still have a lot to learn, from time to time I also feel *the need to write down some of my thoughts* that appear during work.
I think there are two reasons for that. First thing is that I'm not too good at remembering things, so yeah, I note down almost everything that I think
I may need to search for in the future. And I may have put all of those in my private notes, but *why not share them* with the world?

I can see two **opportunities** by making my thoughts public. First is that maybe someone will read some of them and say:
'Well, yeah, that makes sense. This guy has a point, I'll do the same as he does.'.
This would mean the world to me if somebody finds something valuable for themselves here.
And secondly - *my reasoning may be wrong* and in that case I hope someone will come and **explain it to me in the comments**, so I can improve myself.

Enjoy yourself here and don't hesitate to contact me in any case!
