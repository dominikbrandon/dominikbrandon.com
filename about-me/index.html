            <p>Hey, it‚Äôs good to see you here! I don‚Äôt really know how did you find yourself in this place, you‚Äôve reached the end of the Internet, congratulations.
Anyway, as you‚Äôre already here, let me introduce myself to you.</p>

<p>
<img src="/assets/images/dominik.webp" alt="This is how my face looks like" id="about-me-face" />
<span>My name is Dominik Grzelak, I live in Pozna≈Ñ, Poland and I spend most of the time <strong>building software</strong>.
I don't yet consider myself a very experienced coder - it was just 2018 when I started my professional career.
Obviously, I've learned a lot since then. I believe it's largely thanks to great people that I've been lucky to work with,
from whom I could learn, and even more importantly - with whom I could discuss different ideas.</span>
</p>

<p>Even though I feel like I still have a lot to learn, from time to time I also feel <em>the need to write down some of my thoughts</em> that appear during work.
I think there are two reasons for that. First thing is that I‚Äôm not too good at remembering things, so yeah, I note down almost everything that I think
I may need to search for in the future. And I may have put all of those in my private notes, but <em>why not share them</em> with the world?</p>

<p>I can see two <strong>opportunities</strong> by making my thoughts public. First is that maybe someone will read some of them and say:
‚ÄòWell, yeah, that makes sense. This guy has a point, I‚Äôll do the same as he does.‚Äô.
This would mean the world to me if somebody finds something valuable for themselves here.
And secondly - <em>my reasoning may be wrong</em> and in that case I hope someone will come and <strong>explain it to me in the comments</strong>, so I can improve myself.</p>

<p>Enjoy yourself here and don‚Äôt hesitate to contact me in any case!</p>
